#### - DEA will never be a stablecoin, as it was [voted](https://t.me/deusfinance/33986) by the community to not mint any more tokens (shards).
#### - The segniorage stablecoin system will still be developed but eventually without DEA as a keyrole as the community demanded.
#### - Pooling DEA to provide an exit gateway for Vault stakers, enables you to earn the maximum Fees inside the DEUS ecosystem.
#### - Can be bought on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x3b62f3820e0b035cc4ad602dece6d796bc325325&outputCurrency=0x80ab141f324c3d6f2b18b030f1c4e95d4d658778) or [DEUS Swap](https://app.deus.finance/swap).
#### - The liquidity mining event lasting from October 2020 until middle of January 2021 will distribute 110,000 DEA to stakers. After that no more DEA will be minted.

## Why have two protocol tokens?

DEUS could not be pre-minted and thus could not be used for the liquidity mining event. Liquidity mining was meant to let people engage with the DEUS protocol, by letting them farm pre-minted DEA until we launch the stock trading platform by late December 2020.

DEA was initially supposed to become a stablecoin, but the idea was vetoed by the community. Instead, DEA became a low supply coin that has unlimited upside and is the perfect pick for users that had issues with the low price sensetivity of the DEUS token.

The seigniorage stablecoin system will still be developed eventually, but with a different coin serving this role.
