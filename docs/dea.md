## Why have two protocol tokens?

DEUS could not be pre-minted and thus could not be used for the liquidity mining event. Liquidity mining was meant to let people engage with the DEUS protocol, by letting them farm pre-minted DEA until we launch the stock trading platform by late December 2020.

DEA was initially supposed to become a stablecoin, but the idea was vetoed by the community. Instead, DEA became a low supply coin that has unlimited upside and is the perfect pick for users that had issues with the low price sensetivity of the DEUS token.

The seigniorage stablecoin system will still be developed eventually, but with a different coin serving this role.




## More detailed description

You need DEA to get into the Balancer Pools (around 70% of the pooled assets are DEA in some form)
those pools earn around 70% of all fees.
so whenever someone comes to the platform, that doesnt want to trade but instead be a LiquidityProvider and earn fees
he will use the Zapper
to get into the highest yielding pool
the zapper will automatically buy alot of DEA with his money
and put it into the staking pools
this will be done seamlessly
